# benchmarks
This repository is for personal use only or for reference. It doesn't want to be the place where these codes are located. I use these codes for my own benchmarking, so it's very usefull for me. But that's it. Please, refer to the original sites and repositories of the different codes for newer versions, bug fixing, etc
