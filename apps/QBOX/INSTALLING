To compile Qbox:

1. Go to trunk/src

2. Create an architecture include file, e.g. bgq_ctf_essl.mk.  This file should
define the make variables for compiling and linking (CXX, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS
etc.) and should contain the locations of all libraries and include files.

3.  Qbox requires ScaLAPACK and dependent libraries (blas and lapack
or vendor-equivalents, e.g. ESSL), FFTW 2.x or equivalent, and
(optionally) Xerces XML.

4.  Build the code using the ARCH variable to point to this include file, e.g. 

make ARCH=bgq_ctf_essl

If the ARCH variable is not specified, a default value will be guessed
from the hostname or uname commands listed in Makefile.arch.  

5.  Object files are stored in objs-$(ARCH) subdirectories, so one can
compile multiple versions of the code simultaneously in the same
directory.
